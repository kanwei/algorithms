== DESCRIPTION:

This is a Google Summer of Code 2008 project

Written by Kanwei Li, mentored by Austin Ziegler

Using the right data structure or algorithm for the situation is an important
aspect of programming. In computer science literature, many data structures
and algorithms have been researched and extensively documented. However, there
is still no standard library in Ruby implementing useful structures and
algorithms like Red/Black Trees, tries, different sorting algorithms, etc.
This project will create such a library with documentation on when to use a
particular structure/algorithm. It will also come with a benchmark suite to
compare performance in different situations.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Done so far:
* Heaps           - Containers::Heap, Containers::MaxHeap, Containers::MinHeap
* Priority Queue  - Containers::PriorityQueue
* Stack           - Containers::Stack
* Queue           - Containers::Queue
* Deque           - Containers::Deque, Containers::CDeque (C extension), Containers::RubyDeque
* Red-Black Trees - Containers::RBTreeMap, Containers::CRBTreeMap (C extension), Containers::RubyRBTreeMap
* Splay Trees     - Containers::SplayTreeMap
* Tries           - Containers::Trie
* Suffix Array    - Containers::SuffixArray

* Search algorithms
  - Binary Search         - Algorithms::Search.binary_search
  - Knuth-Morris-Pratt    - Algorithms::Search.kmp_search
* Sort algorithms
  - Bubble sort           - Algorithms::Sort.bubble_sort
  - Comb sort             - Algorithms::Sort.comb_sort
  - Selection sort        - Algorithms::Sort.selection_sort
  - Heapsort              - Algorithms::Sort.heapsort
  - Insertion sort        - Algorithms::Sort.insertion_sort
  - Shell sort            - Algorithms::Sort.shell_sort
  - Quicksort             - Algorithms::Sort.quicksort
  - Mergesort             - Algorithms::Sort.mergesort

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'algorithms'
  
  max_heap = Containers::MaxHeap.new
  
  # To not have to type "Containers::" before each class, use:
  include Containers
  max_heap = MaxHeap.new

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8 compatible Ruby, or Ruby 1.9
* C compiler for extensions (optional)

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install
