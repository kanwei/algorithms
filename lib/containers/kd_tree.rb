#     A kd-tree is a binary tree that allows one to store points (of any space dimension: 2D, 3D, etc).
#     The structure of the resulting tree makes it so that large portions of the tree are pruned
#     during queries.
#
#     One very good use of the tree is to allow nearest neighbor searching. Let's say you have a number
#     of points in 2D space, and you want to find the nearest 2 points from a specific point:
#
#     First, put the points into the tree:
#
#       kdtree = Containers::KDTree.new( {0 => [4, 3], 1 => [3, 4], 2 => [-1, 2], 3 => [6, 4],
#                                        4 => [3, -5], 5 => [-2, -5] })
#
#     Then, query on the tree:
#
#       puts kd.find_nearest([0, 0], 2) => [[5, 2], [9, 1]]
#
#     The result is an array of [distance, id] pairs. There seems to be a bug in this version.
#
#     Note that the point queried on does not have to exist in the tree. However, if it does exist,
#     it will be returned.
#
